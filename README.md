Many people believe that keeping track of spending is pointless and hard to accomplish regularly. It actually has a lot of advantages. 
One is to make you more financially savvy. Additionally, keeping track of your spending is beneficial for money and possessions.

This simple project keeps track of income and expenses. We will add, remove, and save items to/from local storage.

Hope this helps :)
